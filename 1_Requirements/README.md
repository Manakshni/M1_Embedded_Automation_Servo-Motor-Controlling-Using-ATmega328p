## Introduction

       This project is about controlling servo motor using Atmega 328p micro controller. Servo motors are a type of electromechanical actuators that do not rotate 
               
       continuously like DC/AC or stepper motors, rather they used to position and hold some object. They are used where continuous rotation is not required so they are
               
       not used to drive wheels (unless a servo is modified). Servos can be used effectively here because the rudder do not need to move full 360 degrees nor they require 
               
       continuous rotation like a wheel. The servo can be commanded to rotate to a particular angle (say 30) and then hold the rudder there. Servos are also used to control the 
       
       steering of RC cars, robotics arms and legs. Controlling a servo is easy by using a microcontroller, no external driver like h-bridge etc are required. Just a control 
       
       signal is needed to be feed to the servo to position it in any specified angle. Here, Recommending servo to rotate upto 360 degree by controlling its movement by automation
       
       using necessary tools.
